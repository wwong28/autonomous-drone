\section{Problem Statement}

Most consumer and professional drones require a skilled human pilot to operate effectively. This requirement limits accessibility and usability for individuals who want hands-free operation, such as content creators, athletes, and event organizers.

\section{Project Need}

There is a need to simplify the process of piloting a drone by removing the requirement for continuous manual control while maintaining safety, usability, and functionality.

\section{Design Objective}

The objective of this project is to create a pilotless autonomous drone that is capable of following a user. The drone will connect to the user’s smartphone via Bluetooth and will be controlled and configured through a mobile application. The system should support both autonomous operation and user interaction when necessary.

\section{Target Clients}

The intended users of this system include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Content creators and YouTubers
    \item Photographers and videographers
    \item Event venues
    \item Athletes
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Requirements}

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Camera module for visual tracking and recording
    \item Improved weight distribution for stable flight
    \item Internal wiring for reliability and aesthetics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Embedded C firmware for the ESP32
    \item Mobile application for control, configuration, and monitoring
\end{itemize}

\section{Remaining Work}

The following items remain to be completed as part of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Status report
    \item Complete technical documentation
    \item Finalized design objectives and specifications
\end{itemize}
