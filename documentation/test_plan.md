# Autonomous Drone – Firmware Connectivity Test Plan

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the initial connectivity and reliability test plan for the ESP32-C3 firmware.
The goal of this phase is to validate communication stability before implementing command/control logic or motor integration.

This test plan focuses on:

- BLE connectivity
- WiFi SoftAP connectivity
- Basic reliability (reconnect + stability)

---

## 2. Test Environment

### Hardware
- ESP32-C3 Development Board
- USB connection to laptop (for serial monitor)

### Software
- ESP-IDF Version: v5.5-dev-3062-ge9bdd39599 (dirty)
- Firmware Branch: main
- iPhone Model: iPhone 15 Pro
- iOS Version: 18.6.2

### Tools
- Serial Monitor (`idf.py monitor`)
- iPhone app called nRF connect for ble connection
- iPhone WiFi Settings

---

## 3. Test Cases

### BLE-01 — BLE Scan + Connect

**Purpose:**
Verify that the ESP32 advertises correctly and accepts connections.

**Setup:**
- Flash `drone_ble`
- Reset board
- Open serial monitor

**Steps:**
1. On iPhone, open nRF connect.
2. Scan for BLE devices.
3. Verify device name appears.
4. Connect to device.

**Pass Criteria:**
- Device appears within 10 seconds.
- Connection succeeds within 10 seconds.
- Serial monitor logs show GAP connect event.

**Evidence to Capture:**
#### iPhone Connected View

### Serial Log Snippet Showing Connection Event.
    - I (23318) NimBLE: connection established; status=0
    - I (23318) NimBLE: handle=1...
    - I (23348) NimBLE:  conn_itvl=24 conn_latency=0 supervision_timeout=72 encrypted=0 authenticated=0 bonded=0

### BLE-02 — BLE Reconnect Reliability

**Purpose:**
Verify stability across repeated connect/disconnect cycles.

**Setup:**
- Device powered and advertising.
- Serial monitor open.

**Steps:**
1. Connect to device.
2. Disconnect from iPhone.
3. Reconnect.
4. Repeat 5 times.

**Pass Criteria:**
- At least 5/5 successful reconnect attempts.
- No firmware crashes or resets.
- Advertising resumes after disconnect.

**Record:**
- Number of successful attempts.
- Approximate reconnect time.

### WIFI-01 — SoftAP Join + DHCP

**Purpose:**
Verify SoftAP initialization and DHCP functionality.

**Setup:**
- Flash `drone_wifi`
- Reset board
- Serial monitor open

**Steps:**
1. On iPhone, open WiFi settings.
2. Select SoftAP SSID.
3. Enter password if required.
4. Confirm connection.

**Pass Criteria:**
- Connection succeeds within 15 seconds.
- IP address assigned (192.168.4.x).
- Serial monitor logs show station join event and DHCP started.

**Evidence to Capture:**
- Screenshot of WiFi settings with assigned IP.
- Serial log snippet confirming connection.

---

### WIFI-02 — SoftAP Stability (2-Minute Hold)

**Purpose:**
Verify connection stability under idle conditions.

**Setup:**
- Connected to SoftAP.

**Steps:**
1. Remain connected for 2 minutes.
2. Observe serial logs for disconnect events.

**Pass Criteria:**
- No unexpected disconnect.
- No firmware reset.
- No DHCP restart events.

## 4. Results Table

| Test ID  | Date       | Firmware Commit | Result | Notes |
|----------|------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| BLE-01   |            |                |        |       |
| BLE-02   |            |                |        |       |
| WIFI-01  |            |                |        |       |
| WIFI-02  |            |                |        |       |

## 5. Known Limitations (Current Phase)

- No command/control characteristic implemented yet.
- No encryption/bonding testing performed.
- No latency measurement implemented yet.
- No motor hardware integrated.

---

## 6. Next Phase Testing (Planned)

- BLE command write characteristic
- ACK via notify
- Latency measurement (timestamp + sequence ID)
- Packet loss measurement
- Failure mode behavior (BLE drop mid-command)

---

## 7. Conclusion

This test plan establishes a verified communication baseline for the autonomous drone firmware.
All future command and motor control functionality will be built on top of this validated transport layer.
