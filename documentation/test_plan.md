# Autonomous Drone – Firmware Connectivity Test Plan

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the initial connectivity and reliability test plan for the ESP32-C3 firmware.
The goal of this phase is to validate communication stability before implementing command/control logic or motor integration.

This test plan focuses on:

- BLE connectivity
- WiFi SoftAP connectivity
- Basic reliability (reconnect + stability)

---

## 2. Test Environment

### Hardware
- ESP32-C3 Development Board
- USB connection to laptop (for serial monitor)

### Software
- ESP-IDF Version: v5.5-dev-3062-ge9bdd39599 (dirty)
- Firmware Branch: main
- iPhone Model: iPhone 15 Pro
- iOS Version: 18.6.2

### Tools
- Serial Monitor (`idf.py monitor`)
- iPhone app called nRF connect for ble connection
- iPhone WiFi Settings

---

## 3. Test Cases

---

### BLE-01 — BLE Scan + Connect

**Purpose:**
Verify that the ESP32 advertises correctly and accepts connections.

**Setup:**
- Flash `drone_ble`
- Reset board
- Open serial monitor

**Steps:**
1. On iPhone, open nRF connect.
2. Scan for BLE devices.
3. Verify device name appears.
4. Connect to device.

**Pass Criteria:**
- Device appears within 10 seconds.
- Connection succeeds within 10 seconds.
- Serial monitor logs show GAP connect event.

**Evidence to Capture:**
#### iPhone Connected View

### Serial Log Snippet Showing Connection Event.
    - I (23318) NimBLE: connection established; status=0
    - I (23318) NimBLE: handle=1...
    - I (23348) NimBLE:  conn_itvl=24 conn_latency=0 supervision_timeout=72 encrypted=0 authenticated=0 bonded=0

### BLE-02 — BLE Reconnect Reliability

**Purpose:**
Verify stability across repeated connect/disconnect cycles.

**Setup:**
- Device powered and advertising.
- Serial monitor open.

**Steps:**
1. Connect to device.
2. Disconnect from iPhone.
3. Reconnect.
4. Repeat 5 times.

**Pass Criteria:**
- At least 5/5 successful reconnect attempts.
- No firmware crashes or resets.
- Advertising resumes after disconnect.

**Results:**
- Attempts: 5
- Success: 5/5
- Advertising resumed after each disconnect: Yes
- Time-to-reconnect: ~instant (<1s, perceived)
- Crashes/resets: None observed
- Disconnect lines:
    - I (8928) NimBLE: disconnect; reason=531
    - I (36668) NimBLE: connection established; status=0
    - these repeated 5 times

### WIFI-01 — SoftAP Join + DHCP

**Purpose:**
Verify SoftAP initialization and DHCP functionality.

**Setup:**
- Flash `drone_wifi`
- Reset board
- Serial monitor open

**Steps:**
1. On iPhone, open WiFi settings.
2. Select SoftAP SSID.
3. Enter password if required.
4. Confirm connection.

**Pass Criteria:**
- Connection succeeds within 15 seconds.
- IP address assigned (192.168.4.x).
- Serial monitor logs show station join event and DHCP started.

**Evidence to Capture:**
- Screenshot of WiFi settings with assigned IP (inside the images folder).
- Serial log:
    - I (492) wifi:mode : softAP (40:4c:ca:89:af:09)
    - I (178902) wifi:station: 5a:a4:48:d9:87:40 join, AID=1
    - I (180112) esp_netif_lwip: DHCP server assigned IP to a client, IP is: 192.168.4.2

**Result**
- Successful
- Notes: Connected <15s, IP 192.168.4.2 assigned, no resets observed.

### WIFI-02 — SoftAP Stability (2-Minute Hold)

**Purpose:**
Verify connection stability under idle conditions.

**Setup:**
- Connected to SoftAP via IPhone.

**Steps:**
1. Remain connected for 2 minutes.
2. Observe serial logs for disconnect events.

**Pass Criteria:**
- No unexpected disconnect.
- No firmware reset.
- No DHCP restart events.

**Results:**
- Duration: >2 minutes (observed)
- Unexpected disconnects: None observed
- Firmware resets: None observed
- DHCP restart events: None observed
- Validation method: Successful search `http://192.168.4.1/` after >2 minutes (page returned: "esp32 c3 test alive")

**Serial Logs**
- I (542) esp_netif_lwip: DHCP server started on interface WIFI_AP_DEF with IP: 192.168.4.1
- I (9702) esp_netif_lwip: DHCP server assigned IP to a client, IP is: 192.168.4.2

## 5. Known Limitations (Current Phase)

- No command/control characteristic implemented yet.
- No encryption/bonding testing performed.
- No latency measurement implemented yet.
- No motor hardware integrated.

---

## 6. Next Phase Testing (Planned)

- BLE command write characteristic
- ACK via notify
- Latency measurement (timestamp + sequence ID)
- Packet loss measurement
- Failure mode behavior (BLE drop mid-command)

---

## 7. Conclusion

This test plan establishes a verified communication baseline for the autonomous drone firmware.
All future command and motor control functionality will be built on top of this validated transport layer.
