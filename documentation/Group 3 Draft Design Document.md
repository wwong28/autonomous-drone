### Evaluation {#evaluation}
Our current prototype demonstrates that the core communication and motor control functions for the autonomous drone are functional. The mobile application successfully connects to the ESP32 controller via Bluetooth and enables the selective activation of individual propellers. These results, validated through structured testing, confirm that the basic design architecture is practical and provides a reliable foundation for future development. 

**Functional Prototype**
The functional prototype consists of an ESP32-based flight controller mounted on a quadcopter 3D-printed frame with four brushless motors and propellers powered by a LiPo battery system. The ESP32 serves as the central microcontroller, providing integrated Bluetooth connectivity and sufficient processing capability for current control functions and future autonomy features. Each motor is connected directly to a dedicated PWM-capable GPIO pin on the ESP32, with shared ground connections and separate power rails for logic and motor operation. 

The ESP32 firmware initializes Bluetooth advertising and accepts connections from mobile devices, as verified in our firmware test plan. The mobile application scans for the ESP32, establishes a Bluetooth connection, and provides controls for individual motors. Our testing successfully demonstrated stable Bluetooth connectivity, including device discovery and reliable reconnection across multiple connect/disconnect cycles.

**Testing**
Testing focused on verifying end-to-end functionality from mobile app input to physical motor response, following procedures outlined in our test plans. 
1. Bluetooth Connectivity Tests
Executed firmware connectivity tests BLE-01 and BLE-02, confirming the ESP32 advertises correctly and accepts connections within 10 seconds. Completed 5 connect/disconnect cycles with 100 % success rate and no firmware crashes. Mobile app tests BT-01 and BT-02 verified device discovery, connection status updates, and clean disconnection handling.

2. Motor Control Verification
Established a Bluetooth connection and sequentially activated each motor via the app interface. Each selection correctly actuated the corresponding physical motor, confirming proper wiring and command mapping. Response time from app input to motor activation was imperceptible, demonstrating adequate communication latency.

3. Test Plan Implementation
Testing followed two documented plans: a comprehensive system-level plan covering mobile app and drone hardware integration, and a firmware-specific connectivity validation plan. This prototype phase prioritized Bluetooth connectivity and the validation of basic motor control. Subsequent phases will implement the remaining test cases, including flight control, telemetry display, and video streaming.

All executed tests met success criteria, confirming reliable Bluetooth communication between the mobile application and ESP32 controller, and accurate motor actuation from app commands. These results validate the prototype's core functionality and establish a tested foundation for autonomous flight development.

#### Collaboration

We used the following tools and processes to coordinate work:

- **Jira** – We used Jira with Kanban boards and Scrum to manage sprints, bugs, and tasks. Epics and stories were broken down into sprint-sized work, and we tracked progress through columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done). Sprint planning were held regularly at our first meeting of the week.
- **GitHub** – The repository was used for all code, documentation, and design files.
- **Discord** – Discord served as the main channel for day-to-day messaging, quick questions, meeting coordination, and sharing updates between synchronous meetings.
