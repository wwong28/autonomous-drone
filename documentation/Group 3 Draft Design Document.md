### Introduction {#introduction}

**Need & Goal Statements**
**Need Statement**

Many independent content creators need dynamic video footage but do not have access to a second person to operate a camera or drone. For example, a travel vlogger walking through a city or a fitness instructor recording an outdoor workout often needs moving shots or aerial perspectives to make their videos more engaging. Current recording setups such as tripods provide only fixed camera angles, while most drones require a dedicated controller and experienced operator. As a result, individuals working alone struggle to capture professional-looking footage. There is a need for a drone system that can be easily controlled by a smartphone, allowing a single user to move the drone and record video simultaneously without requiring additional personnel.

**Goal Statement**

The goal of this project is to design a drone that can be controlled directly from a smartphone using a simple directional interface. When a user presses a direction on the phone, the drone will move in the corresponding direction while capturing video.
Key goals include:
Enabling smartphone-based directional control of the drone.
Allowing users to record video while controlling the drone.
Creating an intuitive control interface that requires minimal training.
Providing a system that allows individual content creators to record themselves without a second operator.
**Personas**

**Research into existing designs**
Several existing drone and camera systems provide aerial recording capabilities, but many are not optimized for simple smartphone-based operation by a single individual.

**DJI Mini Series**
The DJI Mini 3 and Mini 4 drones are popular consumer drones that offer high-quality cameras and stable flight systems. These drones are capable of recording high-resolution video and include automated flight modes such as tracking and waypoint navigation. However, DJI drones typically require a dedicated remote controller for reliable operation. While some smartphone control options exist, the systems are designed primarily for users with some experience flying drones. The learning curve and controller hardware may discourage casual users who only need a simple filming solution.

**HoverAir X1**
The HoverAir X1 is a compact drone designed specifically for quick personal recording. It can automatically follow a subject and capture video without requiring manual control. This product is aimed at casual users who want simple aerial footage. While this system simplifies filming, it relies heavily on automated tracking modes rather than manual directional control. Users have limited ability to control precise drone movement or adjust camera position in real time.

**Ryze Tello**
The Ryze Tello drone is a small drone that can be controlled through a smartphone app using Wi-Fi communication. The app includes on-screen controls that allow users to move the drone in different directions. Although Tello demonstrates the feasibility of smartphone-based drone control, it is primarily designed as an educational or beginner drone. The camera quality and control responsiveness are limited compared to higher-end recording systems.
**Sustainability Statement**
The proposed drone system considers sustainability through efficient energy use, reusable components, and minimizing unnecessary hardware.

The drone will operate using rechargeable batteries, allowing repeated use without generating disposable waste. Efficient electronic components and lightweight materials will help reduce power consumption and extend flight time. The design will also emphasize repairability and replaceable components, such as propellers, batteries, and camera modules. This approach extends the lifespan of the device and reduces electronic waste. Additionally, the system uses the user's existing smartphone as the control interface, eliminating the need for a separate controller and reducing additional hardware production.

Through these design considerations, the system aims to provide a functional product while reducing environmental impact and encouraging long-term usability.

### Evaluation {#evaluation}
Our current prototype demonstrates that the core communication and motor control functions for the autonomous drone are functional. The mobile application successfully connects to the ESP32 controller via Bluetooth and enables the selective activation of individual propellers. These results, validated through structured testing, confirm that the basic design architecture is practical and provides a reliable foundation for future development. 

**Functional Prototype**
The functional prototype consists of an ESP32-based flight controller mounted on a quadcopter 3D-printed frame with four brushless motors and propellers powered by a LiPo battery system. The ESP32 serves as the central microcontroller, providing integrated Bluetooth connectivity and sufficient processing capability for current control functions and future autonomy features. Each motor is connected directly to a dedicated PWM-capable GPIO pin on the ESP32, with shared ground connections and separate power rails for logic and motor operation. 

The ESP32 firmware initializes Bluetooth advertising and accepts connections from mobile devices, as verified in our firmware test plan. The mobile application scans for the ESP32, establishes a Bluetooth connection, and provides controls for individual motors. Our testing successfully demonstrated stable Bluetooth connectivity, including device discovery and reliable reconnection across multiple connect/disconnect cycles.

**Testing**
Testing focused on verifying end-to-end functionality from mobile app input to physical motor response, following procedures outlined in our test plans. 
1. Bluetooth Connectivity Tests
Executed firmware connectivity tests BLE-01 and BLE-02, confirming the ESP32 advertises correctly and accepts connections within 10 seconds. Completed 5 connect/disconnect cycles with 100 % success rate and no firmware crashes. Mobile app tests BT-01 and BT-02 verified device discovery, connection status updates, and clean disconnection handling.

2. Motor Control Verification
Established a Bluetooth connection and sequentially activated each motor via the app interface. Each selection correctly actuated the corresponding physical motor, confirming proper wiring and command mapping. Response time from app input to motor activation was imperceptible, demonstrating adequate communication latency.

3. Test Plan Implementation
Testing followed two documented plans: a comprehensive system-level plan covering mobile app and drone hardware integration, and a firmware-specific connectivity validation plan. This prototype phase prioritized Bluetooth connectivity and the validation of basic motor control. Subsequent phases will implement the remaining test cases, including flight control, telemetry display, and video streaming.

All executed tests met success criteria, confirming reliable Bluetooth communication between the mobile application and ESP32 controller, and accurate motor actuation from app commands. These results validate the prototype's core functionality and establish a tested foundation for autonomous flight development.

#### Collaboration

We used the following tools and processes to coordinate work:

- **Jira** – We used Jira with Kanban boards and Scrum to manage sprints, bugs, and tasks. Epics and stories were broken down into sprint-sized work, and we tracked progress through columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done). Sprint planning were held regularly at our first meeting of the week.
- **GitHub** – The repository was used for all code, documentation, and design files.
- **Discord** – Discord served as the main channel for day-to-day messaging, quick questions, meeting coordination, and sharing updates between synchronous meetings.
